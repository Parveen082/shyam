      Khatu Shyamji is synonymous with Lord Krishna and thus he is worshipped in
      the same form. In Hinduism, KhatuShyam is a manifestation of Barbarika,
      son of Ghatotkacha. The legend begins with the Mahabharata. Barbarika
      alias Khatu Shyamji or Shyam Baba was a grandson of the brave prince,
      Bhima, second of the Pandava brothers. He was the son of Ghatotkacha,
      sired by Bhima through one of his wives, Jagadamba. Even in his childhood,
      Barbarika was a very courageous warrior. He learnt the art of warfare from
      his mother. Pleased with his skills, Lord Shiva gave him three infallible
      arrows. Later, Agni, the god of Fire, presented him the bow that would
      make him victorious in the three worlds. When Barbarika came to know of
      the bitter battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas, he wanted to
      participate in warfare. He promised his mother that he would join the side
      which would be losing. Touching Jagadambaʼs feet, he then rode on his Blue
      Horse equipped with his three arrows and bow. Lord Krishna, disguised as a
      Brahmin, stopped Barbarika to examine his strength. He even tried to mock
      him, saying that he was going to the great battle with only three arrows.
      Barbarika replied that a single arrow was enough to destroy all his
      opponents. He stated that the first arrow is used to mark all the things
      that he wanted to destroy. If he used the second arrow, it would mark all
      the things that he wanted to save. And on releasing the third arrow, it
      would destroy all the things that were marked. Lord Krishna challenged him
      to tie all the leaves of the peepal tree under which he was standing.
      Barbarika accepted the challenge and started meditating with closed eyes
      to release his arrow. Then Krishna, without Barbarikaʼs knowledge, plucked
      one of the leaves of the tree and put it under his foot. When Barbarika
      released his first arrow, it marked all the leaves of the tree and finally
      started to revolve around the leg of Krishna. Bewildered, Krishna asked
      Barbarika why was the arrow revolving around his foot. Barbarika explained
      that there must be a leaf under his foot and the arrow was targeting it.
      Barbarika advised Krishna to move away if he did not want to get hurt.
      Krishna promptly lifted his foot and to his surprise, found that the first
      arrow also marked the leaf that he had hidden. Of course, when the third
      arrow was finally released, it collected all the leaves, including the one
      that was concealed under Krishnaʼs foot, and tied them all together.
      Krishna concluded that the arrows were infallible and blessed. He asked
      the boy whom he would favour in the war. Barbarika revealed that he would
      ﬁght for whichever side was weak. Lord Krishna knew then that the defeat
      of the Kauravas was inevitable. Krishna then sought charity from the youth
      and Barbarika promised him anything he wished. Lord Krishna promptly asked
      him to give his head. Barbarika was shocked. He requested the Brahmin to
      disclose his real identity. Lord Krishna then showed Barbarika a vision of
      his Divine form. He explained to Barbarika that before the battle the head
      of the bravest Kshatriya needed to be sacrificed. And he considered
      Barbarika to be the bravest amongst the Kshatriya warriors, and hence had
      asked for his head in charity. In compliance with the Lordʼs command
      Barbarika sacrificed his head to Krishna. But he also obtained a boon from
      Krishna to the effect that he would be known by one of Krishnaʼs many
      names, Shyam, in the Kaliyug era. Krishna not only granted him the boon
      but also declared that Barbarikaʼs devotees would be blessed and all their
      wishes granted by simply pronouncing his name from the bottom of their
      hearts. Barbarikaʼs sacrifice happened on the twelfth day of the Shukla
      Paksha in the month of Phalgun. The youth requested that though he was
      laying down his skull, he still wanted to see the battle till its end and
      his wish was granted. The head was placed atop a hill overlooking the
      battlefield. When the battle was over, the victorious Pandava brothers
      argued amongst themselves as to who was responsible for the victory. At
      this, Lord Krishna suggested that Barbarikaʼs head had watched the entire
      battle, and he should be allowed to judge. Barbarikaʼs head submitted that
      it was Lord Krishna who was responsible for the victory as his advice,
      presence and game plan had been crucial. It is believed that some years
      after the Battle of Kurukshetra the head was retrieved from the holy pond
      that is located near the present Khatu Shyamji temple. A dip in this pond
      cures a person from all ailments and brings good health. Thus, during the
      fair held in the month of Phalgun, pilgrims throng the pond from various
      places and take a dip to wash away their worldly sins.
